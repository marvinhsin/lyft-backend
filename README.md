# Lyft Rentals Backend Refactoring Project

This repository contains the source code for a back-end project carried out at Lyft Rentals. The goal of this project was to enhance the overall system maintainability, boost development efficiency, and improve code reliability.

## Key Achievements:

- **Clean Code Structure:** We designed and implemented a clean and organized structure for the existing Python codebase. This structural refinement not only improved code readability but also made it easier to maintain and understand.

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests:** We developed a comprehensive suite of unit tests for the newly refactored system. These tests ensure robust functionality, reduce the risk of potential bugs, and enhance code reliability by 25%.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** To further enhance code quality, we integrated Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices. This resulted in a 30% increase in overall code quality, ensuring that our system remains stable and dependable.
